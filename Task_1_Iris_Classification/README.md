# Iris Flower Classification

# Task 1: Iris Flower Classification

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into different species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Steps Performed
1. Imported the required Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning.
2. Loaded the Iris dataset and explored its structure.
3. Performed data preprocessing and handled the features and target labels.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Trained a machine learning classification model on the training data.
6. Evaluated the model performance using accuracy.
7. Tested the model with sample inputs to verify predictions.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Outcome
A machine learning classification model was successfully developed to predict the species of iris flowers with good accuracy. The model can classify iris flowers based on their given measurements.

## Result
The model predicts iris flower species with high accuracy.
