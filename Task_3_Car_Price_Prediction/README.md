# Task 3: Car Price Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build a machine learning model that can predict the selling price of used cars based on various factors such as the car brand, year of purchase, fuel type, transmission type, and mileage.

## Steps Performed
1. Imported the required Python libraries for data analysis and machine learning.
2. Loaded the car price dataset and explored its structure and features.
3. Performed data preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
4. Analyzed the relationship between different features and car prices.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Trained a regression model to predict car prices.
7. Evaluated the model performance using appropriate metrics.
8. Tested the model with sample inputs to verify predictions.

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Outcome
A machine learning regression model was successfully developed to predict the selling price of used cars. The model can estimate car prices based on input features and provides useful insights into factors affecting car pricing.
